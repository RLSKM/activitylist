# activitylist
# inspiration
I wanted an easy way to find activities to enjoy. Sometimes i get very bored and want to try something new.

# what it does
the web app searches for and filters activities to help find your ideal activtiy.

# how it is built
created using flask and chatgpt(i needed help)

# challenges faced
there were a lot of new elements implemeneted that were not taught. I had to search and learn these parts myself. there was also a lot of frustration when i could not figure out why certain elements were not working

# accomplishments
i am proud that i managed to even launch the web app. it functions exactly as i imagined. i am happy to have learned a lot of new elements to programming a web app including flash, sessions and how secret keys work

# whats next for <ActivtiyList>?
i am planning to implement a reccomended system. where the system records your history and recommends related activities based on the data. it may require a bit of ai and machine learning, but i am interested in learning. I would also like to embed related websites into the web app so users have an easier time researching about the activities.
